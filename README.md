# Office Hours
Lately I have been working **a lot** with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/) and have overcome hurdles that I am sure others might be facing as they build their own apps.

- Auth
- Realtime
- Loaders/Actions
- Do I need react-query?
- Sessions
- Nested Routes
- Pathless Routes
- Better error handling
...

The list is long.

I created this repo as a place to add office hour questions related to these platforms. Have a more generic Javascript or Typescript question? Shoot your shot. Although I will pick platform specific questions first, I will try to answer all questions in this repo.

## How to use?
Open an issue with your question, stack and possible a codesandbox. Every Friday I will pick a few questions and answer them to the best of my ability and provide code samples with solutions.
